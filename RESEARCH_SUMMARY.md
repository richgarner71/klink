## Market Gap Analysis: Opportunity for AI-Based Tool

### Current Landscape Limitations

1. **Information Fragmentation**
   - Users must visit 10+ websites/apps to gather comprehensive safety information
   - No single source of truth for kink safety practices

   - One-size-fits-all approach to safety guidance

3. **Limited Interactivity**
   - Most resources are passive (videos, articles)
   - No real-time Q&A or scenario-specific guidance
   - Checklists exist but lack intelligence or context

4. **No Comprehensive Scene Planning**
   - Existing apps focus on single aspects (checklists, habit tracking)
   - No end-to-end scene planning with integrated safety checks
   - Missing risk assessment and mitigation recommendations

5. **Consent Documentation Gaps**
   - Limited tools for documenting consent and negotiation
   - No standardized formats or best practices
   - Difficult to track evolving boundaries and agreements

- **Safe Words**: Traffic light system (Red/Yellow/Green) widely adopted
- **Vetting**: Importance of community vetting and references

### Geographic Coverage
All resources identified serve the North American market, with particular strength in:
- United States (East Coast and West Coast focus)
- Canada (limited specific resources but included in broader platforms)
- Strong presence of in-person events in major cities (NYC, Chicago, San Francisco, LA)

### Community Structure

## Conclusion

This research reveals a **substantial opportunity** for an AI-based kink safety tool that could significantly improve safety outcomes in the community. While existing resources provide valuable education, they lack the intelligence, personalization, and integration necessary for comprehensive safety planning. A well-designed AI tool addressing these gaps would fill a critical need and likely see strong adoption from a community that prioritizes safety and informed consent.
